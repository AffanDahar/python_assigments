    "##### Answer : Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model in which programs are organized around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. Which can contain data, in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures. A feature of objects is an object's procedures that can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior."

    "#### ANS: It provides a clear modular structure for programs which makes it good for defining abstract datatypes in which implementation details are hidden. Objects can also be reused within an across applications .It makes software easier to maintain.Reuse also enables faster development "
